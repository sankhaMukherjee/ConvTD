# ann_conv

Using deep learning for solving coupled differential equations, where the forms of the equations are not known, but there is data avialable in the form of a time-series. 

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a valid Python installation on your system. This has been tested with Python 3.6. It does not assume a particulay version of python, however, it makes no assertions of proper working, either on this version of Python, or on another.
